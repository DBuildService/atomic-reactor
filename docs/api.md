# API

Atomic-Reactor has a proper Python API. You can use it in your scripts or
services without invoking a shell:

```python
from atomic_reactor.api import build_image_in_privileged_container

response = build_image_in_privileged_container(
    "privileged-buildroot",
    source={
        'provider': 'git',
        'uri': 'https://github.com/TomasTomecek/docker-hello-world.git',
    },
    image="atomic-reactor-test-image",
)
```

## Source

The `source` argument to API functions specifies how to obtain the source code
that should be put in the image.

- `provider`
  - `git`
  - `path`
- `uri`
  - If `provider` is `git`, `uri` is a Git repo URI
  - If `provider` is `path`, `uri` is path in format `file:///abs/path`
- `dockerfile_path` (optional): Path to Dockerfile inside a directory obtained
  from URI; `./` is default
- `provider_params` (optional):
  - If `provider` is `git`, `provider_params` can contain key `git_commit` (git
    commit to put inside the image)
  - There are no params for `path` as of now

For example:

```python
git_source = {
    'provider': 'git',
    'uri': 'https://github.com/foo/bar.git',
    'dockerfile_path': 'spam/spam/',
    'provider_params': {'git_commit': 'abcdefg'}
}

path_params = {
    'provider': 'path',
    'uri': 'file:///path/to/directory',
    'dockerfile_path': 'foo/',
}
```
