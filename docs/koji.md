# Koji Integration

## Plugins

These plugins provide integration with [Koji][]

- pre-build
  - `add_filesystem`
  - `koji`
  - `fetch_maven_artifacts`
  - `inject_parent_image`
- post-build
  - `koji_upload`
- exit
  - `koji_import`
  - `koji_tag_build`

### Pre-build

- `add_filesystem`: Provides special handling for images with `FROM
  koji/image-build`. For these images it creates a Koji task to create a
  installed filesystem archive as [described here][]
- `koji`: Creates a yum repofile to allow instructions in the Dockerfile to have
  access to RPMs available from the appropriate Koji tag
- `koji_parent`: Determines the expected NVR (Name-Version-Release) of the Koji
  build for the parent image. It waits for a given amount if build does not
  exist yet
- `fetch_maven_artifacts`: Uses configuration files to download external maven
  artifacts. One of these sources can be a Koji build
- `fetch_sources`: Determines and pulls sources which should be added into
  source container image, based on provided koji build N-V-R/ID
- `inject_parent_image`: Overwrites the parent image to be used based on a given
  Koji build

### Post-build

- `koji_upload`: Runs in the worker build to upload platform specific
  information to koji, and capture platform specifc metadata.

### Exit

- `koji_import`: Runs as an exit plugin in the orchestrator build to gather the
  platform specific metadata from each worker build and combine into a single
  build to be imported into Koji via the Koji Content Generator [API][].

  When importing a build using the Content Generator API, metadata to describe
  the build is generated. This follows the Koji metadata format
  [specification][] but in some cases content generators are free to choose how
  metadata is expressed.

  Each build creates a single output archive, in the Combined Image JSON +
  Filesystem Changeset [format][].

- `koji_tag_build`: Used to tag the imported koji build based on a
  target. Refer to ["koji tags and targets"][]

## Type-specific metadata

### Build metadata

For atomic-reactor container image builds the `image` type is used, and so
type-specific information is placed into the `build.extra.image` map. Note that
this is a legacy type in koji and may be changed to use
`build.extra.typeinfo.image`. Clients fetching such data should first look for
it within `build.extra.typeinfo.image` and fall back to `build.extra.image` when
the former is not available.

Data which is placed here includes

- `build.extra.image.autorebuild` (boolean): `true` if this build was triggered
  automatically; `false` otherwise
- `build.extra.image.triggered_after_koji_task` (int): Only defined for
  autorebuilds, specifies original Koji task ID for autorebuild
- `build.extra.image.isolated` (boolean): `true` if this build was an isolated
  build; `false` otherwise
- `build.extra.image.help` (str or null): Filename of the markdown help file
  in the repository if this build has a markdown help converted to man page;
  null otherwise
- `build.extra.container_koji_task_id` (int): Koji task ID which created the
  BuildConfig for this OpenShift Build ― note that this location is technically
  incorrect but remains as-is for compatibility with existing software
- `build.extra.filesystem_koji_task_id` (int): Koji task ID which atomic-reactor
  created in order to generate the initial layer of the image (for `FROM
  koji/image-build` images) ― note that this location is technically incorrect
  but remains as-is for compatibility with existing software
- `build.extra.image.media_types` (str list): Container image media types for
  which this image is available, where "application/json" is for a Docker
  Registry HTTP API V1 image; currently this key is only set when Pulp
  integration is enabled
- `build.extra.image.operator_manifests` (map): Operator bundle images metadata
- `build.extra.image.operator_manifests.custom_csv_modifications_applied` (boolean):
  indicates if custom user modifications were done to operator bundle images metadata

  related_images in operator bundle
- `build.extra.image.operator_manifests.related_images.pullspecs` (map list):
  list of used pullspecs. Map keys: `original` - original pullspec value in
  CSV; `new` - new pullspec replaces by OSBS; `pinned` - boolean if pullspec
  digest was pinned by OSBS

  organization and tag, its value being a map representing the Koji
  build (if found) for that image, with keys `id` (int) and `nvr` (str).
- `build.extra.image.parent_images` (str list): All parent images given in the
  Dockerfile, in the same order, and unmodified.
- `build.extra.image.index` (map): Information about the manifest list

- `build.extra.image.modules` (boolean, currently Flatpak-only): The [modules][]
  that provide the packages for this image, resolved to `NAME-STREAM-VERSION`.
  This will include the resolved versions of the modules in `source_modules`,
  and the dependencies of those modules.
- `build.extra.image.source_modules` (boolean, currently Flatpak-only): The
  modules that were specified as input to the build process.
- `build.extra.image.odcs` (map): Information about ODCS

- `tags` (str list): Primary tags applied to the manifest list when it was
  created
- `floating_tags` (str list): Floating tags applied to the manifest list when it

The `build.extra.image.go.modules` entries are maps composed of the following
entries

- `module` (str): Module name for the top-level Go language package to be built,
  as in `example.com/go/packagename`
- `archive` (str): Possibly-compressed archive containing full source code
  including dependencies

The `build.extra.typeinfo.icm` entry is map containing the following keys:

- `name` (str): name of icm
- `archives` (str list): names of icm json

For operator builds, the operator manifests metadata is placed in
`build.extra.typeinfo.operator-manifests`. If this is present, the data in

koji.

Data which is placed here includes:

  `bsi` (for source containers), `docker_api`, `imagebuilder`, `buildah_bud`

### Source container metadata

The same note about `image`, `build.extra.typeinfo.image` and
`build.extra.osbs_build` from previous section applies here.

Data which is placed here includes:

- `build.extra.image.media_types`: the same as for image builds (see previous
  section)
- `build.extra.image.sources_for_nvr` (str): koji N-V-R for the original image
  build
- `build.extra.image.sources_signing_intent` (str): signing intent used to fetch
  source RPMs
- `build.extra.submitter`: the same as for regular image builds (see previous
  section)

### Buildroot metadata

In each buildroot, the extra.osbs key is used to define a map that contains
these items:

- `build_id` (str): the build ID which resulted in the buildroot currently
  running atomic-reactor (**currently incorrect**)
- `builder_image_id` (str): the docker pull-by-digest specification for the
  buildroot currently running atomic-reactor
- `koji` (dict): a dictionary containing the following items
  - `build_name` (str): the koji name-nvr of the build
  - `builder_image_id` (dict): the docker digests of the build if availble or an
    empty dict otherwise.

### Output metadata

Each output has a type field. The docker image archive output is identified by
type "docker-image", and has these type-specific data:

- `extra.image.arch` (str): architecture for this image archive
- `extra.docker` (map): information specific to the Docker image

The docker map has these entries:

- `id` (str): the image ID ― for Docker 1.10 and higher this is a
  content-aware image ID
- `parent_id` (str): the image ID of the parent image
- `repositories` (str list): docker pull specifications for the image in the
  docker registry (or in Crane, if Pulp/Crane integration is used), by tag and
  by digests (there may be multiple digests, e.g. v2 schema 1 and v2 schema 2)
- `config` (map): The "v2 schema 2" ['config'][] object but with the
  `container_config` entry removed
- `tags` (str list): the image tags (i.e. the part after the ':' ) applied to
  this image when it was tagged and pushed
- `layer_sizes` (map list): the image layer uncompressed sizes, the oldest layer
  first (the size information comes from docker history command)
- `digests` (map): a map of media type (such as
  "application/vnd.docker.distribution.manifest.v2+json") to manifest digest (a
  string usually starting "sha256:"), for each available media type which can be
  retrieved by digest (media types only reachable by tag are not included).
